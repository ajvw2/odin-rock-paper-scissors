# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' browser game, made following the project instructions on The Odin Project (see: [Project Page 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) and [Project Page 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)). <br>

## Project Description

#### Features

- 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game, playable against a computer opponent
- Selectable score required to win
- Clean, resizeable and responsive UI
- Some simple animation using CSS

#### Commentary

I decided to push my limits a bit on this project and go beyond the requirements. Attempting to make a responsive UI was the biggest challenge, since so far this hasn't really been covered in the course material of The Odin Project. Some trial and error gave me a (far from perfect) result I'm happy with at this stage in my learning process. <br>

Creating basic animations with CSS turned out to be surprisingly simple and treacherously fun. The latter is the case, because the simplicity makes it easy for a
beginner to go overboard and do way too much. I had to trim a lot of experiments out of the final commit for it not to be too busy-looking. <br>

A final challenge was to get some asynchronous timing control going in the JavaScript code. I had to sift through quite a lot of documentation and Stack Overflow posts to finally get it to work. <br>

All in all, this was a fun learning experience that laid some nice foundations for the road ahead. <br>

#### TODO

- Organize JavaScript code
    - Improve function order
    - Update some comments
    - Use less global variables

- Organize styling
    - Minimize required classes and ID's
    - Improve class and ID names
    - Experiment with flex wrapping in the middle section (ideal would be to have the score displays go on top of the icons when the screen width becomes small, so the icons can stay larger)
